KubeCon North America 2023 is coming up next week November 6-9 and we can't wait for all the OpenCost-related events going on!

There will be an [OpenCost Working Session](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/project-engagement/#in-person-project-working-session) on Monday from 9:30 - 10:30am in the Hilton Garden Inn McCormick Place on level 3 in the Premier room. Everyone is encouraged to attend, whether you're an end-user, contributor, or just wanting to learn more about the project. We are planning on discussing the status of Incubation, the roadmap for the project, and future development on carbon footprint and the external asset costs.

OpenCost will be at the [Project Pavilion](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/project-engagement/#in-person-project-working-session) in kiosk F34. We're there the entire duration, so be sure to stop by and say "hi", ask questions, and get stickers and other swag. We're looking for more volunteers to staff the kiosk, why don't you drop by and help answer questions?

Kubecost's Alex Meijer and Michael Dresser are giving the talk "[Node Size Matters - Running K8s as Cheaply as Possible](https://kccncna2023.sched.com/event/95e6d14ed317f08831b04d6d0c535a13)". They will be presenting a study of the system overhead, one of the biggest "hidden" costs of using Kubernetes, across cloud providers' node families and demonstrate new OpenCost functionality for measuring system overhead. This informative session is Wednesday, November 8 from 5:25pm - 6:00pm at W179.

Mark Poko and JuanJo Ciarlante from Grafana Labs will be presenting "[Where's Your Money Going? The Beginners Guide to Measuring Kubernetes Costs](https://kccncna2023.sched.com/event/1R2vE/wheres-your-money-going-the-beginners-guide-to-measuring-kubernetes-costs-mark-poko-juanjo-ciarlante-grafana-labs)". They'll dive into Grafana Labs' usage of OpenCost and how they embed it in their Grafana Cloud platform. We're looking forward to the session Thursday, November 9 from 2:55pm - 3:30pm at W180.

In addition to the OpenCost working session, kiosk, and the presentations we'll be discussing the [new cloud costs feature we just launched](https://www.opencost.io/blog/cloud-costs). Be sure to join us at this week's [Community Meeting](https://bit.ly/opencost-calendar) for a sneak peek, or visit the KubeCon kiosk to learn more about cloud costs or anything else OpenCost-related. See you there!
